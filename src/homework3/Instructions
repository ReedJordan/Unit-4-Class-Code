Problem 1

Create a game of Woodle (play.woodle.today). It is like Wordle, but feedback is just how many letters are in the correct
location, and how many are correct, but in the wrong location. Make sure to not have duplicate letters count twice (if
you choose DINKS and the word is DRUID, it should say the D is in the correct location, but not repeat and say it is in
the incorrect location also).

Hard code a single 5 letter word as the answer (although your code should work with ANY word)
Each time the user enters a guess, display the required information back to them.
When they guess correctly, display how many tries it took them to get the answer.
You may not use any String functions other than substring, equals , or indexOf.
